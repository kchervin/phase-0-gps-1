**what Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Over time - I felt as though I faced a few problems just getting used to Git.  Since I was working alone, I could never be completely sure that I was doing the right thing.  Through trial and error and office hours, I've become much more comfortable.  It was really nice to work with a pair to be able to ask questions and see how someone else works.

**what concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I was able to ask questions and just have a better overall understanding of Git and Github.

**what questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked questions including at what point to create a new branch, when it is necessary to do a pull request when working with a partner, and why the contrasting colors on uploaded files on github

**what still confuses you about Git**

I cant think of anything specific that confuses me.. I noticed myself becoming more comfortable each time I use Git - I continue to notice things that confuse me along the way and try to figure it out/ ask for help as I encounter new/ confusing things

**how was your first experience of pairing in a GPS**

I really enjoyed the GPS - I felt like I had a safety net in the beginning and could ask questions as I encountered them (which is more difficult when I'm working alone).. I also liked seeing how someone else works/ being able to discuss things as occur is definitely helpful in the learning process.
