What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? I was not sure how to resolve a merge conflict, but now I understand it.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS? I was unfamiliar with the git fetch command and my guide Helin helped me understand how it works.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I asked my guide about how to pair properly. I asked my pair about how to insert a picture inline in a markdown file.

What still confuses you about Git? I think I have a good understanding of the git commands and workflow I have learned so far.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? It was a positive experience. It worked similarly to a regular pairing session, but when we had questions the guide was able to help us out. The guide jumped in on occasion to clarify something or give us more info, and the guide did a good job of this.
